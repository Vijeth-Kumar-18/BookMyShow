### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Create a New React App**  
   Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new React application:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app bookmyshow-clone
   ```
   Navigate into the project directory:

   cd bookmyshow-clone
   ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies**  
   Install `react-bootstrap` and `bootstrap` for styling:
   ```bash
   npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
   ```
   Add the Bootstrap CSS to your project by including the following line in `src/index.js`:
   ```javascript
   import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
   ```

3. **Clone the Repository**  
   If you are working with an existing repository, clone it instead:
